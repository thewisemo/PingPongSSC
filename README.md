A #MadeWithUdacity App that counts 2 players/teams Ping Pong score
The Idea came after ending lesson 9 in the Google Udacity Developer Scholarship Challenge 
The App funcitionality is :
A Welcome screen for 3 seconds.
A view with 2 EditText views to give the App user to add 2 players/teams names as Right & Left.
The main view is a score counter for the current/play match.
When a player/team scores 21 point a checkbox set to .isChecked
I wish to add more to the functionality to complete my proud feelings to do something great as a coding start just like this.
I want to view a congratulation popup! " I don't know the right name for it now " that view the wininng player/team name with a take image button to be sharable on any social platform.
